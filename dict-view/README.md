# dict-view

Build-Result of this project is integrated in top-level project.

Before the top-level project (alpha-)dxtionary can be packaged, one must run

```
make all
```

from top-leve project to create the directory `../resource`.

If filenames in this project are changed, so the generated file in `../resource` also
changed. Therfore constants, in `../src/extensions.ts`, which point to these files
must be addapted.
